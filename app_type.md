# Choosing the app type

## Status
This decision is currently being proposed.

## Context
Since we're focusing on developing an app that could be used for both IOS and Android devices, the one option that came into the mind is using React Native. The university's asks such as offline usage as well as high priority notifications are all met with React Native app.

## Decision
React Native Hybrid app is chosen for the project.

## Consequences
Developing an app using react can compromise some performance, but that is backed up by its compatibility and good functionality.
