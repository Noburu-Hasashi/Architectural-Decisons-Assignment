# Permissions

## Status
This decision is currently being proposed.

## Context
The app is supposedly one of the ways the university can give its students alerts such as announcements, assignment deadlines, etc. Therefore, the app has to have a good notification system. To access the accessibility services, access to assistive technologies is also required.

## Decision
The user is expected to allow for the access of notifications, sound, internet for database synchronization as well as access to any other assistive technologies for accessibility services.

## Consequences
The permissions we can ask can also be denied by the user if they feel that it isn't to their benefit that we have clearance. This can terribly alter the app's intended experience.
