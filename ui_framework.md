# UI Framework

## Status
This decision is currently being proposed.

## Context
The mobile app needs to have an impressive, accessible and flexible UI.

## Decision
React Native is perfect choice for our framework as it provides us flexibility with a very responsive UI.

## Consequences
Using a different framework means a lot of work for the developers, but the benifits do outweigh the consequences.
