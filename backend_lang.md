# Backend Language

## Status
This decision is currently being proposed.

## Context
According to the demands, our app needs to be optimized, secure and reliability. The security is of high priority as sensitive info of students is handled. One more important factor for deciding the backend language will be is the compatibility and accessibility for allowing users navigate through the app seamlessly.

## Decision
Node.js is chosen as the backend language. The front end and back end development becomes seamless since the compatibility with React Native is amazing. Node Js also is the right option when it comes to real time features such as push notifications which is one of the requirements for the application itself.

## Consequences
NodeJs has many upsides but having it can also mean that some of the performance is compromised, such as high memory usage compared to Java and limited utilization for the cpu threads.
